Food Standards, Regulations …WHY do we need food standards, regulations and grades?To ensure safety and quality
“Government responsibility for food safety and nutrition is shared
among
federal, provincial, and territorial governments as well as the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).
The Food Directorate works closely with these partners as well as
industry and health stakeholders to ensure the Canadian food supply is
safe and nutritious.”

Consumer protection laws
In summary:
No person shall sell an article of food that
• (a) has in or on it any poisonous or harmful substance;
• (b) is unfit for human consumption;
• (c) consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, disgusting,
rotten, decomposed or diseased animal or vegetable substance;
• (d) is adulterated; or
• (e) was manufactured, prepared, preserved, packaged or stored
under unsanitary conditions.

the foundation of consumer protection laws includes
standards of food identity and composition

Acceptable disease reduction
claims
1) Disease Risk Reduction Claims with Respect to Sodium and Potassium
2) Disease Risk Reduction Claims with Respect to Calcium and Vitamin D

4) Disease Risk Reduction Claims with Respect to Cancer Risk Reduction
4.1) Disease Risk Reduction Claims with Respect to Heart
Disease
Risk Reduction
5) Disease Risk Reduction Claims with Respect to Dental Caries 
Disease reduction claims
 a healthy diet low in sodium and high in potassium and reduced risk of high blood pressure;
 a healthy diet with adequate calcium and vitamin Dand reduced risk of osteoporosis;
 a healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat and reduced risk of heart disease;
 a healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruit and reduced risk of some types of cancers;
 a healthy diet rich in a variety of vegetables and fruit may help reduce the risk of heart disease
 non-fermentable carbohydrates in gums and hard candies and reduction in dental caries
Disease reduction claims
The regulations exclude certain foods from the disease reduction claims (e.g jams and jellies, olives, from fruit and vegetables)
It needs to be considered nutritionally solid
(e.g for saturated fat and trans fat claim, the product needs to be
providing at least10% of the weighted recommended nutrient intake of a vitamin or mineral.)
The claim may accompany the following statement:
(The food name) is a good source/high in/excellent sourceof (specific nutrient)
Is this claim allowed in Canada?
Clarification
A healthy diet
low in saturated
and trans-fats
may reduces risk
of heart disease

Food Additives
Food Additives
Canadian definition
“A food additive is any chemical substance that is added to food during preparation or storage and either becomes a part of the
food or affects its characteristics for the
purpose of achieving a particular technical effect.”
The definition,
does not include
 food ingredients such as salt, sugar and starch;
 vitamins, minerals, amino acids;
 spices, seasonings, flavouring preparations;
 agricultural chemicals*;
 veterinary drugs*;
 or food packaging materials*
* In the US the above are included as additives
(indirect food additives)
In Canada these are contaminants and a
maximum level is set for them
# additives
permitted:
 in Canada ~500• in the US > 3000

What Food Additives are
approved?
Guidelines for use of food additives in Canada:1. safe for continued use
2. must not lead to deception
3. results in an advantage to the consumerby improving or maintaining the nutritive value, quantity, quality or acceptability of the food
permission will not be given if the food additive does not provide and advantage even if it is proven to be safe
What Food Additives are approved?15 categories, based on their function
note that “Preservatives” are one of the 15
tables
see Table in Lesson 4 & “Food Additive Dictionary”

Food additive regulations in Canada
Food and Drug Regulations = Food Additiveshttp://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fnan/securit/addit/list/index-eng.phpEach additive has the following information:
 Purpose of the food additive(s)
(eg 1 of the 15 categories: anti-caking agents) Name of the additive used for that purpose Foods in which they are permitted,
absence = not approved for that particular food Maximum amount permitted
How are food additives approved?(“The food additive approval process”)Read the approval process
Fig 4.3 – the decision making process
How are food additives approved?(“The food additive approval process”)1. Submit applications to Health Canada
 contain specific information on the additive,
amount and purpose of use, methods for
analysis, safety tests, sample etc.
2. Health Canada solicits comments
 from interested parties through an information letter
3. Panel of HC and outside experts weigh the risks
and benefits
 accept or reject the application
How are the acceptable levelsof food additives decided?
animal studies:
 No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) = highest level tested which caused no harmful effects in test animalshumans:
 no effect level = animal NOAEL ÷ safety factor (100 or 1000)
 Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) – daily dose which over an entire lifetime appears to be “without appreciable risk”
 take into account the Probable Daily Intake (based on food consumption estimates)
Only approve if PDI < ADI
No effect level ÷ safety factor = ADI
How are the permissible or acceptable levels of food additives decided?animal studies:
 No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) = highest level
tested which caused no harmful effects in test animals
humans:
 no effect level = animal NOAEL ÷ safety factor (100 or 1000) Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) –
daily dose which over an entire lifetime appears to be “without appreciable risk”
 estimate the Probable Daily Intake (PDI)
based on food consumption estimates
How are the permissible or acceptable levels of food additives decided?
Only approved if PDI < ADI and
there is a justified need (function) for that
additive
According to FAO:
 Maintain nutritional quality
 Enhance stability/shelf life
 Make the food attractive without
deception
 Essential aid to food processing

ANALYSIS OF FOOD
ADDITIVES
Example 1: Aspartame1) Food Additive
2) Classified as: Sweetener (see definition!)
3) ADI= 40 mg/kg bw
Risk/benefit analysis for
Aspartame
Benefits:
Sweetener for:
 Lower caloric content in diet- why?
 Diabetics- why?
 reducing dental caries- why?
Risks:
any evidence of harm to our health?
Risk/benefit analysis for
Aspartame
metabolized to
 aspartic acid, phenylalanine = amino acids
naturally occurring in proteins
 methanol – toxic at high doses, formed in
other foods too
 Pectin of fruits & veg., juices
 1 cup tomato juice = 6x more methanol
> 1 cup diet pop
 Metabolic pathways – excreted
 no effect observed at doses equivalent to 5012-oz cans of beverage!
Risk/benefit analysis for
Aspartame
Other…
 Long-term storage or high temp:
DKP (diketopiperazine)
 not a common food ingredient
 will cause loss of sweetness intensity no evidence of carcinogenicity (?)
Health Canada
 Evaluated toxicological tests in Lab animals
 Continue examining results of clinical studies (humans) No evidence to pose a health hazard to consumers ADI: 40 mg/kg b.w.

No evidence of harm to our health Except:

Risk/benefit analysis for
Aspartame-Labeling requirement contain a statement on the label saying
"contains Aspartame" or sweetened by
Aspartame"; individually or in conjunction with other sweeteners
 list aspartame in the list of ingredients; and must also indicate the aspartame content
expressed in milligrams per serving of the
stated size.

Nitrates, nitrites and nitrosaminesNitrates (NO3

Nitrites (NO2
-) + Amines  Nitrosamines (nitroso compounds)Note: Cured meats are not the major sources of
nitrates (NO3
) and nitrites (NO2
)
take a look at:
Concentrations of nitrosamines, nitrite and
nitrate in foods from total diet study 2001
(Health Canada)
Risk/benefit analysis for
Nitrites
 cured meats - minor contribution to our total nitrites
 tobacco products, beer, fried
bacon – much higher
 intrinsic production via nitrates  nitrites in our saliva
Risk/benefit analysis for
Nitrites-Outcome
Nitrates (NO3
) – naturally in vegetables; also in our saliva;
 Vegetables: 86%; cured meat: 9%;
other foods: 5%
Nitrites (NO2
) – converted from nitrates in our saliva
 saliva: 77%; cured meat: 21%; other
foods: 2%

How important are cured meats in
contributing to nitrosamine exposure?Not all nitrosamines are carcinogenicCured meats -relatively minor contribution, BUT should still try to minimize nitrosamines in them:

◦ Lactic acid cultures + fermentable sugar (acidic pH) to control C. botulinum
