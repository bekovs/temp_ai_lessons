Lesson 3
Fat Substitutes &
Sweeteners (Sugar
substitutes)-
Sensory Perception of
Foods
Lesson objectives
compare and contrast the different types of fat replacers and alternative sweeteners used in foods.
discuss the role that sensory parameters play in our
selection and perceptions of food
Why use fat substitutes?• Lesson 1…
• Consumer trends - demand foods with less fat, less calories and overall healthier.
• health problems- over eating & obesity,
sedentary lifestyle
• developed countries
TYPES OF FAT SUBSTITUTES1. Protein based
2. Carbohydrate based
3. Fat based
HEATED
Egg
white
Protein based-Simplesse®
Ice cream, yogurt, cheese spread, salad dressings,
margarine, mayonnaise, coffee creamer, soups and
sauces.
• Protein is partially coagulated by heat
• create a micro-dispersion: microparticulation• spheres of protein & water are very small (0.1-0.2
microns) 
Fat substitute:
Protein based – e.g. Simplesse®
 soy, milk (whey) or egg white protein
 dispersion perceived as a fluid w/creaminess & richness of fat
 tiny particles are below the size limit that we can feel with our tongue
 1.3 Cal/g
Question: What is an acceptable common
name for "Simplesse" when it is used as an ingredient of a food?
Answer: The common name of Simplesse for use in the list of
ingredients of a food depends on the form of Simplesse used in the final
product. If the Simplesse is made from egg white and milk protein, then
the common name must appear in the list of ingredients as "egg and
milk protein". The trade name "Simplesse" may appear in brackets
following "egg and milk protein". (An earlier suggested common name
"microparticulated protein" is no longer required and there is no
triggering of nutrition labelling.)
If Simplesse is actually "whey protein concentrate", it may be described
as either "whey protein concentrate" or "modified milk ingredient"
(section B.01.010 (3) (b) item 7.1, of the Food and Drug Regulations) in
the list of ingredients. In either case, the trade name "Simplesse" may
appear in brackets following it. (09/MA/90; 20/MR/92; 06/NO/92; MA
25/94.)"
• carbohydrate sources: corn, potato, wheat & tapioca• cellulose, starch, gums, maltodextrins and
fibre
• smooth mouthfeel and bland flavour
• Maltrin is fully digestible: 4 Cal/g (fat = 9 Cal/g)
• Other carbohydrate-based fat replacers available
range from non-digestible to partially digestible
(0-2 Cal/g)
• eg. Avicel, Betatrim
Fat substitute :
Carbohydrate based – e.g. Maltrin®Margarine, salad dressings, frozen desserts, frostings,
processed meat.
 Also known as Olestra
 Approved in USA in 1996
Not Approved in Canada!
 Olestra can withstand high temperatures (e.g.
frying)
 Rich taste and creamy texture of ordinary fat
WHY?
 made primarily from fat
Fat substitute
Fat based – Sucrose Polyester, e.g. Olean®

contributes 0 Cal/g
Fat based – e.g. Olean® / OlestraLarge portions of olestra snacks:
◦ Abdominal cramping or changes in stool
consistency (similar to consumption of highfiber diets)
Not digested/absorbed – thus fat-soluble vitaminsconsumed at the same time are also not absorbed◦ Must mention that vitamins A, D, E and Khave been added
“…because of olestra's physical properties, fat-soluble nutrients present in olestra-containing foodsor other foods in the GI tract at the same time asolestra can partition into olestra and pass throughthe GI tract without being absorbed by the body.Therefore, FDA required the addition of fat-solublevitamins A, D, E, and K, to savory snacks containingolestra to compensate for any inhibition ofabsorption by olestra…”

SWEETENERS
(Sugar substitutes)
Sweeteners and Sweetening agents“Food and drug regulation (FDR)defines:
“sweetener" " means a food additive that is used to impart a sweet taste to food [Ref: Marketing Authorization for Food Additives that May Be Used as Sweeteners]. Examples of food additives that may be used as sweeteners include aspartame, maltitol and sorbitol.
"Sweetening agent" includes any food for which a standard is provided in Division 18, but does not include those food additives listed in the tables to Division 16 [B.01.001, FDR]. Examples of sweetening agents include white and brown table sugar, molasses and honey.”

Why do we use
Sweeteners?
 Sweeteners (Sugar substitutes) intended
for
 those with diabetes
 individuals concerned with high caloric intake reducing the risk of tooth decay (cavities)
• non-caloric
• (not metabolized by the body: 0 Cal/g)
• e.g. Acesulfame potassium (K), sucraloseor
• “non-nutritive” or low-calorie
• contribute < 4 Cal/g but due to high
sweetness  trace amount used
• e.g. Aspartame
SWEETENERS
(Sugar substitutes)
Non-caloric sweeteners
e.g. Acesulfame Potassium (K)
• Discovered in 1967: Sunett, Sweetone• 200 times sweeter than sucrose
• Heat stable
• No contribution to cavities
• Not metabolized by the body (0 Cal/g)• ADI of 15 mg/kg of body weight. 
Non-caloric sweeteners
e.g. Sucralose or Splenda
• a chlorinated molecule
• 3 hydroxyl groups (OH) of the sucrose
molecule are replaced by chlorine (Cl)
• 600x sweeter than sucrose
 glucose or insulin levels
Non-caloric sweeteners
e.g. Sucralose or Splenda
• Heat stable
• Not metabolized by the human body
(0 Cal/g)
• ADI: 9 mg/kg body weight per day• no effect in carbohydrate metabolism• No increase -blood glucose or insulin
levels
!
Low-calorie sweeteners
e.g. Aspartame
• Discovered by accident in 1965 (James Schlatter)• 2 amino acids:
• phenylalanine & aspartic acid
• 180-220x sweeter than sucrose
Low-calorie sweeteners
e.g. Aspartame
• 4 Cal/g
• (due to high Sweetness only use small amount required)• No increase in blood glucose or insulin levels
• ADI: 40 mg/kg body weight per day
• Phenylketonuria (PKU)
• Degrades at high temperatures & overtime
• can not be used on baked goods
• DKP
- best before date necessary on products
!
Low-calorie sweeteners
e.g. Neotame
• Made of 2 amino acids:
• phenylalanine & aspartic acid
• 7000 sweeter than sucrose
Low-calorie sweeteners
e.g. Neotame
• 4 Cal/g
• (due to high Sweetness only use small amount
required)
• No increase in blood glucose or insulin levels
• ADI: 2 mg/kg body weight per day (18 mg/day in US)
• Relatively heat stable
• No problem for people with Phenylketonuria (PKU)
Aspartame Neotame
Do you see any thing interesting from
comparing the structure?
Low-calorie sweeteners
e.g. sugar alcohols
• Sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol…
• naturally in many fruits
• less sweet than sucrose
• Cooling sensation
• Do not promote dental caries
• No major increase - blood glucose or insulin
levels
• slow absorption… laxative effect (threshold
20-40 g/day)
• Partially digested= 1.5 -3 Cal/g

SENSORY PERCEPTION OF FOODS
Let’s go shopping
Sensory testing
Food quality detectable by
our senses:
1. Appearance factors
2. Textural factors
3. Flavour factors
SENSORY PERCEPTION OF FOODS
SENSORY PERCEPTION OF FOODS(1) Appearance
 Colour,
 Size,
 Shape,
 Gloss,
 Consistency,
 Presence of defects
 ……..
• Purple coloured jello cube
• What flavour would you expect to taste? Would you be surprised or be able to identify
lemon
SENSORY PERCEPTION OF FOODS(1) Appearance
non-biased perception of flavour
 blindfolds
Or
 sensory testing facilities with special
lighting (red light)
Texture testingHow do you test for texture?
SENSORY PERCEPTION OF FOODS(2) Texture
fat-soluble & volatile aroma
compounds
• interact w/receptors in the
nose
receptors in the olfactory
region
SENSORY PERCEPTION OF FOODS(3) Flavour
• Flavour – comprises both taste and
smell
•
why food seems bland when we have a cold? -water-soluble
substances
-interact with
sensory receptors
on the tongue
- Detected in the
mouth-tongue 
Why does food seem bland
when we have a cold?
“flavour test”
• taste food with/without aroma
do a “taste test”
• compare the sweetness of sugar placed
near the tip vs sides of your tongue• or try to note the location of your
tongue that sense the bitterness of
coffee or beer
The Basic Taste Sensations
• Basic tastes – sweet, salty, sour,
bitter
• A 5th sensation – umami
• Old and controversial tongue map
Sweet Taste
mono & disaccharides
some amino acids, peptides eg. aspartame
synthetic sweeteners eg. saccharin, cyclamate
others – chloroform, lead acetate!
Salty Taste
K-chloride (used as a salt substitute) gives a bitter as well as salty taste
Na- sulphate – bitter, only slightly salty
Ca- chloride – very bitter
cesium chloride – sweet!
only sodium chloride = true salty
taste
Sour Taste
e.g. vinegar (acetic acid)
others –citric, tartaric, malic, lactic,
fumaric and phosphoric acids.
protonated (H+), organic & inorganic
acids
Bitter Taste
some salts (Na- sulphate, Ca- chloride)
amino acids and peptides (eg. sharpness,
bitterness of aged Cheddar cheese).
typically alkaloids e.g. caffeine in coffee
& tea or theobromine in chocolate
the fifth taste – Umami
(Savoury)
In 1908, Professor K. Ikeda
working with Kombu seaweed,
◦ found a “new taste” to be present
Extracted crystals of Glutamic Acid- GlutamateGlutamate- distinctive taste,
◦ different from Sweet, Sour, Bitter and Salty:
◦
"umami" 
Glutamate Content of FoodsFree glutamate

Beef 33
Chicken 44
Potatoes 102
Tomatoes 140
Broccoli 176
Soy sauce 1090
Parmesan cheese 1200Roquefort cheese 1280
the fifth taste – Umami
Savoury
Some flavour enhancers or potentiators umami
Torula yeast, autolyzed yeast extract, hydrolyzed protein, yeast extract
MSG (monosodium glutamate)–
meaty & vegetable flavours
5’-nucleotides– meaty flavours
Flavour
Enhancers/Potentiators/Modifiersmodify or enhance intensity or quality of
taste of another substance
• eg. MSG, 5’-nucleotides…- umami
• eg. maltol – modifies flavours of high
carbohydrate foods, beverages.
• e.g miracle fruit 
Other mouth/tongue sensationsAstringency
◦ More of a "physical" sensation described as puckering in the mouth; attributed to tanninsor
polyphenols of high molecular weight. (e.g. black tea)
Pungency
◦ Sensation of "spicy heat" in the oral cavity. chili
peppers.
Coolness
◦ Various sugar alcohols such as xylitol and sorbitol or compounds such as menthol (e.gchewing gum)
