Lesson 2
Chemical & Physical
Properties of Food
Opening remark
 foods are mixtures of chemicals
 They can be as simple as sugars or complex
in milk or muscle foods
 interact to produce:
sensory, chemical & physical
characteristics and their behaviour under
different conditions
Lesson Objective
 Compare and contrast food- colloidal dispersions;
 Summarize the functional properties of carbohydrates, proteins and fats in foods;
 Distinguish between caramelization and
the Maillard browning reaction and state the importance of these reactions in food;
 Explain the function of emulsifiers and stabilizersin
emulsions;
 Interpret the importance of water, pH, and minor constituents in quality and safety of foods
 Outline the minor constituents of foods
Food/ Colloidal Dispersions
Small particle systems (particles < 600 microns)Particles of one substance are distributed (dispersed phase) in another substance (continuous phase) without dissolving
Foams
 Dispersions of gas in liquid/solid
 Cake frostings
 Air beaten into the white is the dispersed phase Egg white is the continuous phase

Mayonnaise
 OIL phase dispersed in highest proportion… Remains as OIL in WATER (not W/O)
 Unstable
 Adding oil- Rate & order important!
 Other compounds required to compensate for reducing oil
Low fat Mayonnaise:
 the oil is dispersed in
vinegar (water), with
egg yolk as the
emulsifier
 Egg yolk components act as connectors
between oil and water and don’t let them to
separate.

Carbohydrates
 Organic compounds
 Body’s main source of energy
 Digestible carbohydrates  4 Cal/gram Contribute ~ 50% of daily caloric intake,
 recommended in the form of complex CHs (rather than simple CHs)
 Found mainly in foods from plant sources
 Fruits, vegetables, grain products, legumes
Carbohydrates
Simple carbohydrates (mono and disaccharides)
◦ eg, table sugar
◦ Sweetness is determined by their molecular structure& interaction with sensory receptors in the tongueComplex carbohydrates (polysaccharides)
◦ eg. starch, fibre (cellulose)
Carbohydrates

Glucose, fructose , galactose

“Simple sugars”, not chemically bonded to other
sugar molecules
 They vary on their sweetness
 see Table 2.2 for sweetness index of various sugars in comparison to sucrose (table sugar)
 e.g Fructose (140 s.i.) > glucose (70-80 s.i.)

Carbohydrates
Functional properties of simple
carbohydrates
 Sweetening power
 Reactants in non-enzymatic browning
 Crystallization
 Viscosity/mouthfeel
 Fermented by microorganisms
 Antimicrobial agents
 Humectancy (water retention)
Guiding Questions
 Name mono and di-saccharides you learned in this course.
 What is an invert sugar?
 What are the sugars in Nectar and Honey? What is HFS and how is it made? Describe the role of enzymes.
 What are the functional properties of simple
carbohydrates?
Critical Thinking Questions Compare and contrast Invert sugar and High
Fructose syrup.
 Honey bees use invertase to convert Sucrose
to Fructose and Glucose. Why the ratio of
Glucose and Fructose in Honey is not 1:1?
Carbohydrates
Functional properties of simple Carbohydrates Sweetening power
 sweetness index (s.i.)
 Sweetness is not necessarily correlated to
calories!
 eg. fructose and lactose both have 4
Cal/gram
 yet fructose is 7X sweeter than lactose only need 1/7th as much fructose for an
equivalent sweetening power to lactose!
 Therefore 1/7th less caloric intake
Carbohydrates
Functional properties of simple carbohydrates Reactants in non-enzymatic browning:
1. Caramelization
◦ heating sugar alone to high temp (200C)◦ Aroma compounds (caramel, butterscotch flavours) & brown pigments
◦ eg. caramel candies, toffees
◦ colour used in cola beverages is created by caramelizing sucrose
(110-203C)
Carbohydrates
Functional properties of simple
carbohydrates
 Reactants in non-enzymatic browning:
2. Maillard browning
◦ Reducing sugar + amino compounds
◦ reducing sugars contain a
“free” OH on the position next to
the O in the ring structure
◦ eg., glucose, fructose, galactose, lactose
◦ sucrose is a non-reducing sugar
e.g. proteins or amino acidsbut can be hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose by high temp or acid …
Carbohydrates
Functional properties of simple carbohydrates Products of Maillard browning reaction:
 Low molecular weight (Intermediate Compounds)
(aroma/flavours – both desirable and undesirable)
 High molecular weight polymers (melanoidins) (brownblack pigments)
 E.g. toast, roasted coffee, potato chips, bread
 Sunless tanning lotions too!

Carbohydrates
Functional properties of simple carbohydrates Crystallization
 Sugars can exist in both soluble (as syrup) and
crystalline states
 Crystallized from solution = e.g. table sugar
(sucrose) from the sugar cane juice

Functional properties of simple carbohydrates Body (Viscosity) and mouthfeel
 Fermented by microorganisms
 Antimicrobial Agents
◦ (Lesson 5)
 Humectancy (Affinity for moisture)
 Simple carbohydrates are hygroscopic
 Affects state of water in food systems
Sticky lollipops…Invert sugars [fructose, glucose] are very hygroscopic,
• Attract water from the atmosphere

Do you know the secret?

Functional properties of simple carbohydrates Ripening phenomenon
 Invertase is added to the crystallized firm center Storage facilitates the ripening of the product
 Enzyme slowly inverts sucrose to
mixture of sucrose, fructose & glucose This mixture does not crystallize easily since invert sugar is highly hygroscopic (vs. sucrose alone)
 Produces a soft (syrupy)center
Critical Thinking Questions Compare and contrast Caramelization and
Maillard Reaction.
 How can sucrose get involved in both
reactions?
 How invertase can be used in production of
liquid/creamy centred chocolate?
Carbohydrates: Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides
◦ High molecular weight polymers or long chains of monosaccharide units
◦ Eg. cellulose, starch = polymers of glucose
◦ Form part of cellular structure & firmness of
tissues (eg. cellulose, pectins, gums)
◦ Energy reserve of animals & plants
(eg. Glycogen, starch)
Carbohydrates:
c) Polysaccharides
Sources: plants, seaweed, plant exudates,
microbial products
 Differ from simple sugars:
 Usually insoluble in water & tasteless
 Applications in food: thickening, suspending
solids, stabilizers or gelling agents
Carbohydrates:
c) Polysaccharides
 Pectin
 Agar
 Alginates
 Gum arabic/acacia
 Carrageenan
 Xanthan gum
 Starch
 Cellulose, hemicellulose
Carbohydrates

c) Polysaccharides- Starch
Starch…
 Present in plant materials as ‘starch granules’
 starch molecules in the form of densely packed bundles Two parts of starch molecules:
Amylose
(linear) Amylopectin
(branched)
a1-6
◦ Starch granules contain both linear amyloseand branched amylopectin
◦ normal corn starch has 1:3 amylose:amylopectin
Carbohydrates
c) Polysaccharides- Starch
Amylose molecules contribute to gel formation:
 the linear chains
orient parallel to each other,
moving close enough together to bond
(Hydrogen bonds) 
Carbohydrates
c) Polysaccharides- Starch
Branched amylopectin molecules give viscosityto the cooked paste.
 Sidechains- bulky shape
 keeps them from bonding together
 Does not contribute to gel formation 
Carbohydrates
c) Polysaccharides- Starch
Starch…
◦ insoluble in cold water….but
◦
“gelatinization”
◦ heating + water,
◦ starch granules swell and eventually burst
◦ starch molecules absorb water 
Starch gelatinization When starch is
heatedin water, the bonds joining amylose +amylopectinare weakened
This allows water molecules to
“move in” and form H-bondsRaw starch

Carbohydrates
c) Polysaccharides- Starch
After gelatinization (i.e. upon cooling, cold storage):
 linear amylose chains orient back into crystalline zones(intermolecular H-bonding)
 form aggregates; syneresis (loss) of water
 The phenomenon is called “retrogradation”
 Causes loss of water holding capacity, toughening of food, gritty texture (eg. Stale bread, gritty starch puddings) Accelerated by Refrigeration temperatures
 partially reversed by heating
Carbohydrates
c) Polysaccharides- Cellulose
Cellulose
 Most abundant of all Carbohydrate polymers Plant cell wall material
 Linear chains of glucose units
 Linked by b- 1,4
 INDIGESTIBLE
 Part of the dietary fiber component of foods
starch a- 1,4, 1-6 => digestible
cellulose b- 1,4 => indigestible
 Both are chains of glucose units
Carbohydrates
c) Polysaccharides- Starch
Functional” properties of PolysaccharidesStabilizers/Thickeners/viscosity
Keep compounds, mixtures or solutions from
changing state.
Act as thickening agents by increasing the
viscosity of the continuous phase
Gelling agents (form gels L/S); gelatinizationFat replacers
